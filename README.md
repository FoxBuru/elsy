# Lancope Lifecycle

This repo contains the lifecycle (`lc`) binary. It provides a standardized development workflow for common types of projects. It is primarily a wrapper around docker-compose.

## Project Templates
`lc` contains docker-compose templates for the most commonly used build tools used in Lancope. A project template provides a set of docker-compose services which you may override in a project's `docker-compose.yml` file.
